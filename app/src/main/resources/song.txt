BE WITH YOU

[1]
Verse 1:
Savior of my soul
I confide in You
Through all my darkest moment
In You, I find my peace
My comfort when I'm weak
I trust in You, through storm and raging sea

[1, 2]
Verse 2:
Faithful, You're my God
You're the Glory and the Lifter of my head
Your light it fills my days
It leads me in Your ways
Forever I surrender all to You

[1, 2, 3]
Chorus:
And I live to worship You
My Jesus You're the only One for me
Nothing will ever take Your place
My precious Savior
Who can stand between my Lord and me

[1, 2, 3]
Lord I live to honor You
And I long to bring my life an offering

[1, 2, 3, 4]
Take me higher
Draw me deeper

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
I give all to be with You
